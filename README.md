## <p align="center"> Getting Started 🌌 </p>

I'll be using Javascript/Python as my languages of choice to tackle all these problems but you could try them with whatever language you feel comfortable.
Each problem will provide a link on top of the main javascript file, in case you also want to try doing them on their official website.
